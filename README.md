#Library Management System with Redux, Axios, and JSON Server
#Project Definition:
Develop a Library Management System that allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a collection of books. The application will be built using React for the front-end, Redux for state management, Axios for making HTTP requests, and JSON Server to simulate a RESTful backend API. 
#Features:
1.Create Book:
Users can add new books to the library.
Book details include title, author, genre, and publication year.
2.Read Books:
Display a list of all books available in the library.
Each book entry shows the title, author, genre, and publication year.
3.Update Book:
Users can edit the details of an existing book.
Changes are reflected both in the UI and the backend.
4.Delete Book:
Users can delete a book from the library.
The deleted book is removed from both the UI and the backend.
5.State Management with Redux:
Centralized state management for the entire application.
Actions and reducers to handle the state changes for book operations.
6.HTTP Requests with Axios:
Fetch books from the backend.
Send POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to the backend for creating, updating, and deleting books.
7.Mock Backend with JSON Server:
Use JSON Server to simulate a RESTful API.
Store book data in a JSON file (db.json).
8.Responsive UI:
Ensure the application is user-friendly and works well on different devices.
